# Final Outcome of the Analysis

Expatriates' job performance is integral to multinational organizational growth and sustainability. 
International Human Resource practices are a significant driver among several factors contributing 
to expatriates' performance. Previous studies have shown that internal HRM, specifically under 
some HRM practices, has a positive relationship with expatriate job performance. However, only a 
small study was undertaken to determine the factors related to selected IHRM practices influencing 
expatriates' job performance. This study was conducted at ABC (Pvt) Ltd to study the influence of 
selected IHRM practices on expatriate’s job performance. This study has studied three factors 
related to IHRM: international training and development, international performance appraisals, and 
international compensations influencing expatriates' job performance at ABC (Pvt) Ltd. The data is 
collected from 60 respondents in the random sample. The data analysis revealed that all the above
mentioned three factors related to international human resource practices have a positive 
relationship with expatriates' job performance. Among them, international compensation practices 
showed the highest positive relationship with expatriate’s job performance. Hence, to enhance the 
expatriate's job performance of ABC (Pvt) Ltd, it is recommended to consider improving the 
international compensation and training and development practices.
